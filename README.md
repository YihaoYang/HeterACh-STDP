# HeterACh-STDP
Repository for study: Acetylcholine facilitates localized synaptic potentiation and location specific feature binding

You need Python 3.7 (or above) to run the scripts.

This directory consists of: 
* Neuro2Nets.py: a Python code containing the methods and the class to run and analyze the simulations
* Example_simulation.py: an example python code to run a set of simulations and draw raster plots and visualize synaptic potentiation
* SpatialSimulations.py: a Python code containing the methods to run and save data for analysis
* FigsPlotting.py: a Python code for visulization and analysis
